        Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer, 
        songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. 
        Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural 
        icons of the 20th century. Over a four decade career, his world record 
        music achievements and publicized personal life made him a global 
        figure. Jackson's songs, stages and fashion proliferated visual performance for singers in 
        pop music. His innovations changed the music video as an art form and popularized street dance moves including the moonwalk
        , which he named, 
        the robot, and the anti-gravity lean.

        As part of the Jackson family, Michael at age six made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5 signed with Motown in 
        1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael as lead 
        singer. Jackson began his solo career 
        in 1971 while at Motown and recorded multiple successful singles. He became a global solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" 
        from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art 
        form and promotional tool. He helped popularize 
        MTV and continued to innovate with videos for his albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the
         first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 1]
